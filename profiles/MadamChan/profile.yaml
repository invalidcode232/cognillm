  situation:
    "Family background: The family of 5 is now living in a Public Rental Housing
    Unit. There are 2 rooms in the flat unit. One is for 2 children and Madam CHAN
    another is for husband. After the delivery of the baby, Madam CHAN sleeps together
    with the baby on the same bed. Madam CHAN married with her husband in the Mainland
    in 2007 and their daughter and son were born in the Mainland. She and her children
    got the one-way permit in 2015. Madam CHAN expressed that the couple relationship
    was fine before she and the children came to Hong Kong and the situation became
    worse and there were more conflicts since the union. They often had argument in
    the financial issue and the parenting. Madam CHAN was angry of husband’s great financial
    support for his parents and siblings in China which had indirectly influenced the
    family expenditure. Madam CHAN got unplanned pregnancy in August, 2019 and husband
    suggested Madam CHAN to have abortion initially; however Madam CHAN thought that
    it was belonged to her and she insisted on keeping the baby eventually. Madam CHAN
    was also angry with husband’s indifferent attitude toward the youngest daughter
    as he seldom helped to look after and play with her. Financial situation: After
    arrived to Hong Kong in 2015, Madam CHAN was working as a part-time worker in restaurant
    and earned 6,000 per month. She has resumed her part-time work in mid-August after
    the delivery of her youngest daughter. She works in the mornings. Her husband is
    working as an air-conditioner technician and earned monthly income around 20,000.
    Although the total income of the family was reported to be satisfactory, husband
    often used up his income for supporting his family in China and he could hardly
    give out stable amount of money for the family maintenance. The family expenditures
    mainly relied on the limited income of Madam CHAN. Conflict often arose over the
    monetary arrangement. Supportive Network: Madam CHAN enjoyed working and she thought
    that working would divert her focus on the dissatisfactory marital relationship.
    However, Madam CHAN never disclosed her marital distress to colleagues because she
    didn’t want others to spread out rumors about her. She has good relationship with
    her younger sister who lives in the same estate with her own family. She pays little
    amount of money, around $1,500 for her sister to help her look after her youngest
    daughter when she works in the mornings. She reported that her sister’s family financial
    situation is also quite poor, so she hopes that the little amount of money can help
    relieving her sister’s burden.Madam CHAN’s parents are living in China with her
    youngest brother. She expressed that she felt sorry for not able to taking care
    of them. She was often worried about their health and she thought that her youngest
    brother did not treat them well as he had to work for long time and the parents
    were left at home alone. She always wanted to find time to visit them but both financially
    and for time, it was really difficult. Since her arrival in Hong Kong in 2015, she
    has been visiting them for two times.'"
